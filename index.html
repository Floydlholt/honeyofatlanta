    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
        Honey of Atlanta is more than just raw and local, it’s made in backyard hives—maybe even your neighbor’s yard! That’s our concept for Honey of Atlanta. We integrate bees into the local ecosystem through a network of backyard hives instead of lumping them together on some distant apiary. The bees live as they naturally would and their benefits reach more people. Our goal is to raise Atlanta’s bee population throughout the city and at the same time spread awareness among the community. Our hope is that these backyard hives will facilitate a dialogue among neighbors, friends, family and the community at large about the importance of bees.
        
        <p>We like to think of it as pollinating hearts and minds.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Raw honey is best described as honey “as it exists in the beehive”. It is made by extracting honey from the honeycombs of the hive and pouring it over a mesh or nylon cloth to separate the honey from impurities like beeswax and dead bees.  Commercial honey are additionally processed by undergoing ultrafiltration. This process further refines it to make it more transparent and smooth, but it can also remove beneficial nutrients like pollen, enzymes and antioxidants.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Honeybees Importance</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Many domestic and imported fruits and vegetables require pollination. Examples include avocados, soybeans, asparagus, broccoli, celery, squash, and sunflowers for oil, cucumbers, citrus fruit, peaches, kiwis, cherries, cranberries and melons. For crops such as blueberries and almonds, the honey bee plays an essential role in pollination of commercial crops,  with around 80% of the US crop said to be dependent on honey bees. And that is not to mention the huge range of manufactured food products made from all these ingredients.</p>
